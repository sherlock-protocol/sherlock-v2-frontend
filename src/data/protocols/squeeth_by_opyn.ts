  description:
    "Squeeth (squared ETH) is a Power Perpetual that tracks the price of ETH². This functions similar to a perpetual swap where you are targeting ETH² rather than ETH. Long Squeeth gives traders a leveraged position with unlimited ETH² upside, protected downside, and no liquidations. Squeeth buyers pay a funding rate for this position. In contrast, short Squeeth is a short ETH² position, collateralized with ETH. Traders earn a funding rate for taking on this position, paid by long Squeeth holders.",
